# Modeling-and-Simulation

**Predator–Prey Simulation**

An agent-based Predator–Prey simulation built with Python and Pygame, modeling ecosystem dynamics such as flocking behavior, hunting strategies, reproduction, energy management, and environmental constraints. The project combines real-time simulation with post-simulation data analysis using Matplotlib.

**Overview**

This project simulates interactions between prey, predators, food resources, and obstacles in a 2D environment. Each agent follows biologically inspired rules that govern movement, survival, reproduction, and decision-making.

The simulation highlights emergent behavior, population dynamics, and resource balance, making it suitable for Artificial Intelligence, Complex Systems, and Data Analysis applications.

**Features**
Prey Agents

Flocking behavior (alignment, cohesion, separation)

Predator avoidance and food-seeking behavior

Energy-based survival and reproduction

Movement trails and energy visualization

Predator Agents

Intelligent prey-hunting behavior

Energy consumption and reproduction logic

Dynamic pursuit strategies

Environment

Periodic food spawning and consumption

Static obstacles with collision avoidance

Boundary-aware agent movement

Data Analysis

Population tracking over time

Birth statistics for prey and predators

Automatic visualization using Matplotlib after simulation ends

Technologies Used

Python

Pygame

Matplotlib

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Controls
Key	Action
P	Add prey
O	Add predator
F	Add food
B	Add obstacle
N	Remove obstacle
Close window	End simulation and display statistics

**Output**

After closing the simulation window, the program generates:

Population evolution over time (prey, predators, food)

Total birth counts for prey and predators

These visualizations help analyze ecosystem stability and emergent patterns.
